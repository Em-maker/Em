		A website is like a book series encasing.

		<div class="book-1"></div>
		<div class="book-2"></div>
		<div class="book-3"></div>
		<div class="book-4"></div>

	You can pick out a book of your choice & read it, meaning when you click on a link, it leads to an external website or another page on your website, in which that page contains a story. All the books relate back to the series common theme. Sometimes you have to read them in order but sometimes you donâ€™t have to as they will make sense in the context of the main web page (book series).</p>
