	<p>Lialina’s believes the idea of diminishing the word “user” and replacing it with the word “people” is actually dangerous.  She says to protect the word “user” at all costs, as it keeps the two classes of users and developers separate. She argues that by mashing the two words together and replacing it with “people” instead, is a wrong move as the user will lose their rights for eg. in being able to voice how they feel about the software the developers are creating, have personal choices & control over their computer.</p>

	<p>Lialina’s describes her ideal internet user as a “Universal User/Turing Complete User”, one that achieves their everyday goals on the web through other methods not just intended apps or devices for them to use. A user that can also figure out the computer system no matter their level of knowledge they have, given enough time and respect.</p>

	<p>A recent example of gaps being filled as me, the user, was the process of my tuition payment. In between these steps I’m mentioning would be a user “gap”. 
	1. I went on my email on my phone, saw I had a tuition payment due soon.
	2. I go on my laptop to check the tuition price on My OCADU Records.
	3. I talk to my parents and they tell me to get a Proof of Enrolment letter to get RESP money.
	4. I go back on laptop to quickly google search for that letter.
	5. I print it.
	6. Fill it out.
	7. Scan it.
	8. Figure out the most efficient way to send this to the office of registrar. 
	9. Email them and ask if I can send a scan to them.
	10. Wait for their response.
	11. They reply in a few days.
	12. I submit it. (Currently waiting still).</p>
